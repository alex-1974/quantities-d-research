# R13 — Public API shape: CTFE and UFCS

Research-only M1 API probe.

## Goal

Select a public M1 call shape only after exercising it as normal D code.

The API must preserve the semantics fixed by ADR 0001–0005 while being:

- naturally usable with UFCS;
- usable in CTFE;
- `@safe pure nothrow @nogc` for the static core where the operation permits;
- friendly to type inference;
- explicit at Unit boundaries;
- free of ambiguous raw-scalar construction;
- suitable for thin typed boundaries around scalar numerical kernels.

## Hard gates

### CTFE

Representative construction, extraction and exact conversion must work in
`enum`/compile-time expressions.

### UFCS

Operations on an existing Quantity should read naturally as D:

```d
q.inUnit!Metre
q.convertTo!OtherSpec
```

or an equally clear alternative.

UFCS must not force Unit identity into `Quantity!(Spec, Rep)`; ADR 0001 remains
unchanged.

### No ambiguous scalar constructor

This must not become the public meaning:

```d
Quantity!(Length, double)(12.0)
```

because the Unit of `12.0` is unstated.

Construction must name a Unit or use an explicitly canonical-only entry point.

## Candidate call sites

The probe evaluates shapes equivalent to:

```d
auto a = quantity!Metre(12.5);
auto b = 12.5.quantity!Metre;

enum c = 1L.quantity!Kilometre;
enum metres = c.inUnit!Metre;

auto canonical = a.canonicalValue;
```

The exact names are provisional.

## Questions

1. Is free-function + UFCS construction clearer than a static factory?
2. Should `quantity!Unit(value)` infer Spec from Unit, or must Unit name a
   default Spec?
3. Because one Dimension can have several Specs (Length, Radius, Height), is
   Unit-only construction semantically under-specified?
4. Is the safer constructor therefore `quantity!(Spec, Unit)(value)`?
5. Should a convenience constructor exist only for a generic base Spec such as
   Length?
6. What is the least surprising accessor for canonical scalar extraction?
7. Which conversions return a scalar in a requested Unit versus a new Quantity?
8. How should checked/rounded conversions compose with UFCS?

## Initial semantic warning

ADR 0002 deliberately separates Unit from Spec. Therefore Unit alone cannot in
general determine Quantity semantics.

For example, metre can measure Length, Radius, Height or LinearResolution.
Consequently:

```d
12.0.quantity!Metre
```

is attractive UFCS syntax but is not automatically semantically sufficient.

R13 must not trade ADR 0002's semantic distinction for shorter syntax.


## First probe result — 2026-09-27

The initial free-function/UFCS candidate builds, links and runs successfully on
both baseline compilers:

- DMD 2.111: PASS;
- LDC 1.41: PASS.

Confirmed:

- CTFE construction works;
- CTFE extraction through `inUnit!Unit` works;
- UFCS construction works;
- Spec remains explicit at construction;
- same Unit can be used with distinct Specs without changing Quantity identity;
- zero-overhead storage remains intact for the representative probe.

This confirms feasibility only. It does not yet select the final public call
shape.

## Competing API shapes for the next gate

### A — free-function / UFCS construction

```d
auto q = quantity!(Length, Metre)(12.5);
auto q = 12.5.quantity!(Length, Metre);
```

Strengths:

- natural UFCS;
- explicit Spec and Unit;
- ordinary function template inference for Rep.

Cost:

- two template arguments at every non-canonical construction site.

### B — Spec-centred factory

Conceptually:

```d
auto q = Length.quantity!Metre(12.5);
```

or an equivalent compile-time factory vocabulary.

Potential strength:

- visually groups semantic meaning before Unit.

Potential cost:

- D does not provide namespace-like static methods on arbitrary user-defined
  Spec types without additional declaration machinery;
- may require mixins/helpers that conflict with ADR 0003's deliberately simple
  structural declaration model.

### C — Unit-centred factory

Conceptually:

```d
auto q = Metre.quantity!Length(12.5);
```

This remains semantically explicit but puts measurement Unit before quantity
meaning. It also risks encouraging Unit declarations to accumulate API
machinery that belongs to quantities-d rather than user-defined Unit metadata.

### Current bias

A remains the least intrusive candidate because it preserves ordinary structural
Spec/Unit declarations and gives UFCS naturally. B and C must demonstrate a
material usability benefit before adding declaration or mixin machinery.


## Competing-shape result — 2026-09-27

All three construction shapes build, link and run successfully on both baseline
compilers:

- DMD 2.111: PASS;
- LDC 1.41: PASS.

Therefore the alternatives provide no compiler-feasibility advantage.

### Selection candidate

Shape A remains the preferred M1 surface:

```d
quantity!(Spec, Unit)(value)
value.quantity!(Spec, Unit)
```

Reasons:

1. It preserves ADR 0003 structural declarations without adding mixins or
   wrapper-factory types.
2. It is naturally UFCS-compatible.
3. It works in CTFE.
4. Rep is inferred from the value.
5. Spec and Unit remain explicit and independent as required by ADR 0002.
6. User-defined Specs and Units do not need quantities-d-specific methods.
7. It minimizes public API machinery.

Spec-centred and Unit-centred wrapper factories are therefore not selected
unless later consumer evidence demonstrates a material usability benefit.

### Final gate before promotion

Before accepting the call shape, R13 still requires compile-negative coverage
for:

- mismatched Spec/Unit Dimension;
- invalid Spec declaration;
- invalid Unit declaration;
- attempts to bypass Unit-explicit construction;
- CTFE use of valid construction/extraction.

Diagnostics should fail at the quantities-d API boundary, not as deep template
errors.


## Compile-negative diagnostic result — 2026-09-27

The API-boundary diagnostic gate passes on both baseline compilers:

- DMD 2.111: 3/3 PASS;
- LDC 1.41: 3/3 PASS.

Confirmed boundary failures:

- mismatched Spec/Unit Dimension;
- invalid Spec declaration;
- invalid Unit declaration.

The diagnostics are emitted at the quantities-d construction boundary rather
than as unrelated deep-template failures.

One final gate remains before promotion: verify in a multi-module probe that
the raw Quantity payload cannot be constructed directly by external consumer
code.


### Module-boundary probe adjustment

The first DMD run confirmed the intended semantic boundary for raw construction:
the private Quantity constructor is rejected from the external consumer module.

DMD reports this as "is not accessible from module" rather than using the word
"private". The runner now matches the access-control meaning instead of a
compiler-specific adjective.


### Private-field diagnostic behavior

DMD hides the private payload field strongly enough that an external consumer
may receive "no property canonical_" instead of "not accessible". Both
diagnostics prove the same required module-boundary property: external code
cannot observe or mutate the raw canonical payload directly.

The runner therefore accepts either access-control form while still requiring
the compile to fail.


## Final result — promoted

The final module-boundary gate passes on both baseline compilers:

- DMD 2.111:
  - public construction accepted;
  - raw constructor rejected;
  - private payload access rejected;
- LDC 1.41:
  - public construction accepted;
  - raw constructor rejected;
  - private payload access rejected.

R13 is therefore promoted by
`docs/adr/0006-ctfe-ufcs-construction-api.md`.

Selected M1 call shape:

```d
quantity!(Spec, Unit)(value)
value.quantity!(Spec, Unit)
```

CTFE and UFCS are normative requirements for the static core.
